		   <h1>My favorite Chinese food </h1>


		  

		   <p>Lots of chinese food in SF is americanized, that doesn't mean it isn't good it more means that it isn't traditional chinese food. We are very lucky to have such a culturally diverse city with an amazing Chinatown. Chinatown does have amazing resturauts but you can also find these resturaunts in almost every neighborhood.</p>
